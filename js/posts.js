        "content": "I think a lot of people are very confused and don’t know what is good and what is bad. I count myself among this group.\n\nI think it’s bad that the money supply is in the hands of a small coterie of unelected technocrats but also when DJT goes crazy and starts firing people because they won’t lower interest rates or whatever I think that’s bad too. I think it’s bad when Liz Truss tries to radically lower taxes but I think as someone in the highest democratic office she should be able to do this without unelected bond investors telling her she can’t. And this is truer today when bond yields are about to break new highs in Britain and in France, and there is nothing good here, there rarely is."

        "content": "I walked from Barbican to Baker's Street and then up through Regent's Park to Primrose Hill and then down Regent's Canal to King's Cross and then down through Farringdon and back to Barbican. I thought it would clear my head and it did a little but mostly it just made my knees sore. I saw a manic child jump fully clothed into Regent's Park Boating lake, it was amazing."
